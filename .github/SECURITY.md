## 🛡️ Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

The Terraform Modules team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### Where to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to the maintainer [@mtnvencenzo](https://github.com/mtnvencenzo) or via email.

### What to Include

To help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue, please include as much of the following information as possible:

- 🎯 **Type of issue** (e.g., privilege escalation, resource exposure, credential leakage, etc.)
- 📁 **Module(s) affected** and version numbers
- 📍 **Location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- ⚙️ **Special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- 🔄 **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- 💥 **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- 🎯 **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

## 📞 Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving your report
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days with a more detailed response
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical issues within 30 days

## 🏆 Recognition

We believe in acknowledging security researchers who help improve our security:

- 📝 **Security Advisory**: We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- 🎖️ **Hall of Fame**: Recognition in our security contributors list

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Module Users

- 🔄 **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest stable versions of modules
- 🔑 **Credential Management**: Use Azure Key Vault for sensitive values, never commit secrets
- 🌐 **Network Security**: Implement proper network segmentation and access controls
- 📱 **Access Control**: Use principle of least privilege for service principals
- 🏷️ **Version Pinning**: Pin module versions to avoid unexpected changes

### For Module Developers

- 🛡️ **Input Validation**: All module variables are validated and constrained
- 🔒 **Secure Defaults**: Modules use secure default configurations
- 📊 **Sensitive Variables**: Mark sensitive variables appropriately
- � **Provider Versions**: Specify minimum secure provider versions
- � **Documentation**: Document security considerations for each module

## 📋 Security Checklist

Our security measures include:

- ✅ **Module Scanning**: Automated security scanning via tools like tfsec
- ✅ **Code Analysis**: Static analysis in CI/CD pipelines
- ✅ **Secrets Management**: No secrets in module code, proper sensitive variable handling
- ✅ **Access Control**: Modules follow least privilege principles
- ✅ **Resource Security**: Secure resource configurations by default
- ✅ **Regular Updates**: Automated provider and dependency updates
- ✅ **Variable Validation**: Input validation and type constraints

## 🏗️ Module-Specific Security

### Variable Security
- 🔒 **Sensitive Variables**: Properly marked sensitive variables
- 🔐 **Input Validation**: Comprehensive variable validation and constraints
- 🚫 **No Defaults for Secrets**: Sensitive values require explicit input

### Resource Security
- 🔑 **Secure Defaults**: Resources configured with security best practices
- 🏷️ **Resource Tagging**: Proper tagging for security and compliance
- 🌐 **Network Isolation**: Network security configurations where applicable
- 📊 **Audit Logging**: Audit and logging enabled where appropriate

### Module Dependencies
- 🔄 **Provider Versions**: Minimum required versions for security fixes
- 📦 **Dependency Management**: Regular updates to provider versions
- 🔍 **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated scanning for known vulnerabilities
